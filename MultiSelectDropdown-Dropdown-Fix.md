# Fix for MultiSelectDropdown Trapped Dropdown List

## Problem

The dropdown list (data-test-id="multi-select-dropdown-list") is hidden because it's overflowing its parent container, even though it appears in the DOM. This is happening because of overflow constraints on the parent containers.

## Solution

I've implemented the following changes to fix this issue:

1. **Removed `overflow: "hidden"` from parent containers:**
   - Removed it from the main container (data-test-id="multi-select-dropdown")
   - Removed it from the button container (data-test-id="multi-select-label")

2. **Changed dropdown positioning strategy:**
   - Changed from `position: "absolute"` to `position: "fixed"`
   - This removes the dropdown from the normal document flow, allowing it to display outside of any overflow constraints

3. **Dynamic position calculation:**
   - Added dynamic calculation of the top position based on the button's position
   - Added dynamic width calculation based on the container width

4. **Increased z-index:**
   - Increased z-index to 1000 to ensure it appears above other elements

### Why this works:

Using `position: "fixed"` means the dropdown is positioned relative to the viewport rather than its parent container. This allows it to break free from any parent container's overflow constraints.

The dynamic positioning ensures it still appears exactly where it should, right below the trigger button, while maintaining the proper width.

### Potential Issues to Watch For:

1. If the page scrolls, the dropdown will stay fixed in the viewport. You might need to update its position on scroll if this is an issue.

2. If the component is used inside a modal or other fixed/absolute positioned container, you might need to adjust the positioning logic.

3. The z-index value (1000) may need adjustment depending on your application's stacking context.

These changes should ensure the dropdown list is visible and functions properly even when placed inside containers with overflow constraints.
